'ifconfig'
  The 'ifconfig' command is used to configure network interfaces in Unix-like operating system.
  It is commonly used to assign an IP address to a network interface, enable or disable an interface, view information about an interface, 
  configure the subnet mask and default gateway, and set up network aliases.

    You can use the ifconfig command to view information about an interface, like this:
      'ifconfig eth0'
    This will display the current configuration of the eth0 interface, including its IP address and netmask.
