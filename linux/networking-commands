--------------
 The 'ifconfig' command is used to configure network interfaces in Unix-like operating system.
 It is commonly used to assign an IP address to a network interface, enable or disable an interface, view information about an interface, 
 configure the subnet mask and default gateway, and set up network aliases.

    You can use the ifconfig command to view information about an interface, like this:
    'ifconfig eth0'
    This will display the current configuration of the eth0 interface, including its IP address and netmask.

    Example of how you might use the ifconfig command:
    ifconfig eth0 192.168.100.5 netmask 255.255.255.0
    This command assigns the IP address 192.168.100.5 to the eth0 interface, with a netmask of 255.255.255.0.
    
    Another example:
    ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.100
    This is going to assign the IP address 192.168.1.100 to the eth0 interface.
