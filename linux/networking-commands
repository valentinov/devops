|'ifconfig'|
------------
 The 'ifconfig' command is used to configure network interfaces in Unix-like operating system.
 It is commonly used to assign an IP address to a network interface, enable or disable an interface, view information about an interface, 
 configure the subnet mask and default gateway, and set up network aliases.

    You can use the ifconfig command to view information about an interface, like this:
    'ifconfig eth0'
    This will display the current configuration of the eth0 interface, including its IP address and netmask.

    Example of how you might use the ifconfig command:
    'ifconfig eth0 192.168.100.5 netmask 255.255.255.0'
    This command assigns the IP address 192.168.100.5 to the eth0 interface, with a netmask of 255.255.255.0.
    
    Second example:
    'ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.100'
    This is going to assign the IP address 192.168.1.100 to the eth0 interface.

|'ip addr show'|
----------------
 The 'ip addr show' command is used to display the configuration of network interfaces on a Linux system. 
 It is similar to 'ifconfig', but it is more powerful.
 
    To view the configuration of the eth0 interface, you can use the following command:
    'ip addr show eth0'

|'traceroute'|
--------------
 'traceroute' or 'tracert' on Windows is used to determine the path that network packets take from the source machine to a destination.
 It does this by sending a series of packets to the destination with increasing time-to-live (TTL) values, and displaying the IP address
 of each router that the packets pass through on their way to the destination.

    Let's see an example of how to use the command:
    'traceroute google.com'
    This will show the path of packets from your machine to the specified domain name or IP address of the google.com.
    
    Options for traceroute command: -I option to use ICMP packets instead of UDP, or use -T option for TCP

|'netstat'|
-----------
 The 'netstat' command is used to display information about network connections, routing tables, and network interface statistics. 
 It can provide information about the status of various network protocols, including TCP, UDP, and ICMP.
 
     To display a list of active TCP connections and the status of each one, we can use the following command:
     'netstat -t'
     'netstat -antp'
     'netstat -antp | grep <portnumber>
     'ss -tunlp'
